Description: Segmentation procedures for dividing floor maps into single rooms or areas.
 It contains four different algorithms for doing this: 1. A morphological algorithm, which provides morphological operations on the map and finds the room-like areas with opencv. (common/src/morphological_segmentation.cpp) 2. A distance-transformation based algorithm, which first produces a distance-transformed map using opencv, then takes a variable threshold over the map, coloring everything above it white, and finds the areas of the rooms in the threshold-map. (common/src/distance_segmentation.cpp) 3. A voronoi-based algorithm, which produces a generalized voronoi-diagram in the map, finds critical Points in a epsilon-neighborhood on the graph and partion the map with the borders trough this critical Points. (common/src/vornoi_segmentation.cpp) 4. A semantic-labeling algorithm, which calculates simple single-valued features for a given Position and classifies to which class (room, hallway) this Position belongs using Ada-Boost from opencv. (common/src/semantic_segmentation.cpp) 5. A mix of the semantic-labeling and the voronoi-based algorithm, called voronoi-random-fields. It creates a conditional-random-field out of a pruned generalized Voronoi-graph and uses the weak-responses of the AdaBoost classifiers to find the best labels for each node. Advantage of this over the semantic labeling is that it can take care of neighbor-relations, which allows to detect doorways, as well as rooms and hallways. (common/src/voronoi_random_field_segmentation.cpp) For more detailed descriptions see the corresponding files. This algorithms often uses OpenCV, so it's very important for these algorithms.
